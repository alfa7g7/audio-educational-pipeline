01," And now, yes, we can begin the lesson. Alright. This is it. Okay. But anyway, happy, happy Wednesday, my dear. It's another, you know, class, alright, for the week, right? So, but before we begin, alright, how was your week so far? Because we are in the middle part of it, you know, we call it hump day. Yeah. Right? So, how was it? Quite good so far, and we have a small break tomorrow because it's a holiday in Madrid. So, I'm telling you that you will have some students cancelling your lessons for sure. True, true. Because I... Tomorrow. Tomorrow, exactly. I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah, tomorrow. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Tell me, tell me. I'm sorry, go ahead, my piece. I was thinking that probably a lot of students also take Friday as a free day. So... So that they can make another... A long weekend. A long weekend, yeah, exactly. Right. So far, tomorrow, I'll be having, I think, hold on, let me check. One, two, three, four hours. So, a little bit short, okay? And then, on Friday, no cancellations as of the moment. No cancellations yet, so far. Yeah, yeah. And I also have two temporary classes. So, I don't think they would like to have the extension, right, of the long weekend. Let's see, let's see. Because definitely, it's back to, you know, back to a normal routine. Because tomorrow, it's going to be a local holiday, right? Exactly. Not a... Not national, only in Madrid province. Not in Spain, not in Catalonia, for example, only Madrid. Exactly, right? Okay. Basically, when it's a local holiday, what do you guys love to do? Or is there any in particular that you, you know, you would like to... Honestly, there's not much space for anything at all when it is only one day long. So, waking up late, maybe instead of having a... Exactly. I love that. Instead of having a toast for breakfast, you maybe go on to a fancy brunch. Brunch. Yeah. Exactly. You can do the same. Some avocado toasts with quality latte. Yeah, the latte. Right. Sounds like a nice plan. And nothing, nothing really different from a daily routine. Besides, nothing... Not working at all, which is quite... Right. Quite nice to have once in a while. So, nothing special, I'd say. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's something that we, you know, have to enjoy. That's it. Right? Mm-hmm. And again, it is a Thursday. All right? So, the next day, you have to go back to work. Yeah. Right? Since it's just a day. You have no time to... A local holiday. You have no time to completely disconnect and forget about everything in your life. Right. Right? It's just a 24-hour break. Right. Right. Right. For me, if the holiday is like this, like, oh, God, I still have one more, you know, day for me to finish the entire week. Yeah. I don't normally go on a trip. I don't make plans. All right? Because for me, it's just like an extra day off. All right? To, you know, to rest, to have a longer, you know, sleep. Right? To be a couch potato for the day. All right? Like, watch a movie, bake cookies, cake. Right? Or other. Pastries. Watch some Netflix. Exactly. Amazon Prime. Exactly. What else? Or, for example, like in my case, as much as possible, I really love walking. All right? Brisk walking is one of my favorite activities every day. All right? So, if I just do like one hour per day, since it is my free day. All right? Because it's a holiday. What I do, at least two hours. All right? Or, for example, one hour. Do you do that by yourself or do you go with some people? With my boyfriend, by myself, or with my sisters. All right. Anybody who's available for the moment. Okay. For example, or you can say that one hour for brisk walking because this is your routine. Another hour could possibly go to... Go to... Go to... Go to... Go to... Go to... Go to... Go to... Go to..."
